SLUB Entity Facts TYPO3 Extension
=================================

This TYPO3 extension is primarily meant to show additional facts of historical
personalities or places recorded in the [GND (Integrated Authority File, German: Gemeinsame Normdatei)](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File>).

Those facts are taken from the [Entity Facts webservice](http://www.dnb.de/entityfacts>)
of the German Nation Library (DNB - Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). There is no
registration necessary. You just need some GND identifier.
