Configuration Reference
=======================

The following documentation was tested with TYPO3 7.6.x - 9.5.x. The extension has no further dependecies.

You can install the extension automatically via extension manager or semiautomatically via GitHub. The automatic way is straight forward(self-explaining) so in the following the GitHub process is explained. At first checkout the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/slub/slub_entityfacts
    
The extension key is "slub_entityfacts". Thus the following directory must keep the SLUB_EntityFacts in your document root:

    typo3conf/ext/slub_entityfacts/
