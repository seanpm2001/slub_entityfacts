Users Manual
============

Target group: **Editors**

To use this plugin create a new content element and add the "Entity Facts listing"
plugin on your page. You can now edit and configure the plugin in the backend.

To show any data in the frontend you need a GND ID of your desired entity. You
may show only on entity in one plugin.

There are several properties available to be selected. The order of the
values/items in the frontend will be the same as configured in the backend flexform.

It is possible to select additional links to other sources like wikipedia, that
is the last check mark.

The default CSS file "/Resources/Public/Css/SlubEntityfacts.css" will be
included by TypoScript when including the TypoScript template.
